* Launch Speed
* Launch Angle
* Pitch Velocity
* Strikezone

Even though both hitters had very similar homerun numbers their hitting profiles are completely different. Aaron Judge's homeruns generally have a higher launch speed and lower launch angle than Giancarlo Stanton's homeruns. On average, Aaron Judge also hits homeruns on faster pitches than Stanton does. Like most great power hitters, both players hit a lot of homeruns on pitches in the center of the strikezone. Judge is least likely to hit a home run on pitches high and away while Stanton does not hit many home runs low and away. Regardless, I would not want to pitch against either of these hitters.
