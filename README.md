# FAANG Analysis

## Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, pandas datareader, matplotlib

## Data Source 
The data was obtained from yahoo using datareader.

## Data Description
The data is pulled from Yahoo and converted to a pandas dataframe. It contains information about the daily high, low, open, and closing price of each stock.

## Project Goal
FAANG refers Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. These companies are considered 5 of the best tech companies in the world. In the following notebook I will import stock market data and analyze the relationship between the stocks and the S&P 500 index.

## Conclusion
5 different stocks were analyzed and compared to the S&P 500 index.
* Facebook
* Apple
* Amazon
* Netflix
* Google

Important to note that since 2015, Amazon and google have outperformed the rest of the stocks by a large margin. Utilizing scatter matrices, heatmaps, and calculating values such as average and standard deviation the correlation between the daily returns and risk of the stocks can be analyzed. The S&P 500 is the safest investment of but also provides the lowest average return. Netflix is the riskiest investment but also offers the highest average return. All of FAANG has a positive correlation with the performance of the S&P 500 because they have such a huge market share.

## Next Steps
An interesting next project would be to calculate the optimal portfolio of FAANG stocks for the greatest return possible from the period of 2015 to 2020.
